This project demonstrates my ability to use  (QMD) for reproducible data analysis and reporting in R. It integrates data wrangling, visualization, and mathematical modeling to explore real-world and mathematical datasets.

The analyses include:

Armed Forces Data Wrangling — examining gender and rank distributions across military branches.

Popularity of Baby Names — visualizing name frequency trends from 1880–2014.

Box Maximization Problem — modeling and optimizing the volume of an open-top box using a cubic function.
